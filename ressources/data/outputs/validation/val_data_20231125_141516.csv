A total of 151 cases of Covid-19 would provide 90% power to detect a 60% reduction in the hazard rate (i.e., 60% vaccine efficacy), with two planned interim analyses at approximately 35% and 70% of the target total number of cases (151) and with a one-sided O'Brien-Fleming boundary for efficacy and an overall one-sided error rate of 0.025. The efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine could be demonstrated at either the interim or the primary analysis, performed when the target total number of cases had been observed. The Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function was used for calculating efficacy boundaries at each analysis. At the first interim analysis on November 15, 2020, vaccine efficacy had been demonstrated in accordance with the prespecified statistical criteria. The vaccine efficacy esti-mate, based on a total of 95 adjudicated cases (63% of the target total), was 94.5%, with a one-sided P value of less than 0.001 to reject the null hypothesis that vaccine efficacy would be 30% or less. The data and safety monitoring board recommendation to the oversight group and the trial sponsor was that the efficacy findings should be shared with the participants and the community (full details are available in the protocol and statistical analysis plan).

The primary efficacy end point in the interim and primary analyses was assessed in the perprotocol population. Participants were evaluated in the treatment groups to which they were assigned. Vaccine efficacy was defined as the percentage reduction in the hazard ratio for the primary end point (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo). A stratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the vaccine efficacy of mRNA-1273 as compared with placebo in terms of the percentage hazard reduction. (Details regarding the analysis of vaccine efficacy are provided in the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix.)\nSafety was assessed in all participants in the solicited safety population (i.e., those who received at least one injection and reported a solicited adverse event). Descriptive summary data (numbers and percentages) for participants with any solicited adverse events, unsolicited adverse events, unsolicited severe adverse events, serious adverse events, medically attended adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of the injections or withdrawal from the trial are provided by group. Two-sided 95% exact confidence intervals (Clopper-Pearson method) are provided for the percentages of participants with solicited adverse events. Unsolicited adverse events are presented according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 23.0, preferred terms and system organ class categories.\nTo meet the regulatory agencies' requirement of a median follow-up duration of at least 2 months after completion of the two-dose regimen, a second analysis was performed, with an efficacy data cutoff date of November 21, 2020. This second analysis is considered the primary analysis of efficacy, with a total of 196 adjudicated Covid-19 cases in the per-protocol population, which exceeds the target total number of cases (151) specified in the protocol. This was an increase from the 95 cases observed at the first interim analysis data cutoff on November 11, 2020. Results from the primary analysis are pre-sented in this report.

Of note, the trial was designed for an infection attack rate of 0.75%, which would have necessitated a follow-up period of 6 months after the two vaccine doses to accrue 151 cases in 30,000 participants. The pandemic trajectory accelerated in many U.S. regions in the late summer and fall of 2020, resulting in rapid accrual of 196 cases after a median follow-up of 2 months. It is important to note that all the severe Covid-19 cases were in the placebo group, which suggests that mRNA-1273 is likely to have an effect on preventing severe illness, which is the major cause of health care utilization, complications, and death. The finding of fewer occurrences of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection after a single dose of mRNA-1273 is encouraging; however, the trial was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose, and additional evaluation is warranted.\nThe magnitude of mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher than the efficacy observed for vaccines for respiratory viruses, such as the inactivated influenza vaccine against symptomatic, virologically confirmed disease in adults, for which studies have shown a pooled efficacy of 59%. \nOverall, the safety of the mRNA-1273 vaccine regimen and platform is reassuring; no unexpected patterns of concern were identified. The reactogenicity associated with immunization with mRNA-1273 in this trial is similar to that in the phase 1 data reported previously. \nThe New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org on August 3, 2023.

The overall incidence of unsolicited adverse events reported up to 28 days after vaccination and of serious adverse events reported throughout the entire trial was similar for mRNA-1273 and placebo. A risk of acute hypersensitivity is sometimes observed with vaccines; however, no such risk was evident in the COVE trial, although the ability to detect rare events is limited, given the trial sample size. The anecdotal finding of a slight excess of Bell's palsy in this trial and in the BNT162b2 vaccine trial arouses concern that it may be more than a chance event, and the possibility bears close monitoring. \nKey limitations of the data are the short duration of safety and efficacy follow-up. The trial is ongoing, and a follow-up duration of 2 years is planned, with possible changes to the trial design to allow participant retention and ongoing data collection. Another limitation is the lack of an identified correlate of protection, a critical tool for future bridging studies. As of the data cutoff, 11 cases of Covid-19 had occurred in the mRNA-1273 group, a finding that limits our ability to detect a correlate of protection. As cases accrue and immunity wanes, it may be- The efficacy of the RNA-1273 vaccine in preventing Covid-19 in various subgroups in the per-protocol population was based on adjudicated assessments starting 14 days after the second injection. Vaccine efficacy, defined as 1 minus the hazard ratio (mRNA-1273 vs. placebo), and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with Efron's method of tie handling and with the treatment group as a covariate, adjusting for stratification factor if applicable. Race and ethnic group categories shown are White (non-Hispanic) and communities of color (all others, excluding those whose race and ethnicity were both reported as unknown, were not reported, or were both missing at screening). Data for communities of color were pooled owing to limited numbers of participants in each racial or ethnic group, to ensure that the subpopulations would be large enough for meaningful analyses. come possible to determine such a correlate. In addition, although our trial showed that mRNA-1273 reduces the incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the data were not sufficient to assess asymptomatic infection, although our results from a preliminary exploratory analysis suggest that some degree of prevention may be afforded after the first dose. Evaluation of the incidence of asymptomatic or subclinical infection and viral shedding after infection are under way, to assess whether vaccination affects infectiousness. The relatively smaller numbers of cases that occurred in older adults and in participants from ethnic or racial minorities and the small number of previously infected persons who received the vaccine limit efficacy evaluations in these groups. Longer-term data from the ongoing trial may allow a more careful evaluation of the vaccine efficacy in these groups. Pregnant women and children were excluded from this trial, and additional evaluation of the vaccine in these groups is planned.\nWithin 1 year after the emergence of this novel infection that caused a pandemic, a pathogen was determined, vaccine targets were identified, vaccine constructs were created, manufacturing to scale was developed, phase 1 through phase 3 testing was conducted, and data have been reported. This process demonstrates what is possible in the context of motivated collaboration among key sectors of society, including academia, government, industry, regulators, and the larger community.

RNAs can manipulate gene expression through several biological mechanisms. For example, siRNAs and miRNAs can inhibit protein production; long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can affect epigenetic signaling; mRNA can produce functional protein; and sgRNAs, along with the Cas9 enzyme, can induce permanent changes to genomic DNA. 
Early work focused on targeting siRNA to the liver because DDS are often cleared by it, and because its dysfunction can lead to diseases including cancer, cardiovascular dysfunction, and metabolic disorders, among others.

This transient feature meets the need for many applications which require protein expression for only limited periods of time, such as gene editing, cell reprogramming, and some immunotherapies. However, the synthetic mRNA-based therapeutics also suffer from some drawbacks such as instability, immunogenicity and inefficient delivery, which have long hindered the clinical progression. Nowadays, these issues have been substantially addressed mainly due to our increased knowledge on understanding mRNA modifications and structures, and the advances of nucleic acid delivery technologies.\nIn the last decade, the field of naturally occurring chemical modifications on cellular mRNA, also known as RNA epigenetics or RNA epitranscriptomics, has been under the spotlight. Among these natural mRNA modifications, m 6 A is the most abundant and the most extensively studied regarding its functional roles in mRNA fate determination at a posttranscriptional level. The m 5 C and modifications were discovered to naturally exist in cellular mRNA in recent years, and are being actively investigated for its functional roles in control of gene expression. The cell itself may have modification code deposited on specific mRNA to regulate its metabolism and fate.\nThese progresses in understanding the roles of natural mRNA modifications inspire us to rethink about the therapeutic applications using synthetic modified mRNAs. It should be pointed out that a certain base modification tends to be site-specific in natural cellular mRNA at a low modified/unmodified ratio (less than 1%), while it is randomly distributed in synthetic mRNA at a higher modified/unmodified ratio (25 -100%). It can be seen that the modification distribution and extent exert a big impact on the RNA functions. The m 6 A modification in cytoplasmic mRNA, which is enriched near stop codon and at 3 -UTR at 0.3 -0.5%, plays pivotal roles in regulating mRNA decay and translation in a contextdependent manner, while the synthetic mRNAs with partial or full substitution of A with m 6 A are transfected into cell and reveal a very poor translation efficiency, possibly due to the activation of the cellular m 6 A-mediated decay pathway. The high translation efficiency of m 5 C-and -modified synthetic mRNAs is mainly attributed to their excellent stability by avoiding the activation of the RNA-binding protein-mediated degradation pathways. These results remind us that there is a vast room to explore in this field if we can synthesize site-specifically modified mRNA in a tailor-made way. However, it is a lack of such method to prepare a long mRNA molecule in a scalable fashion. Further, our understanding on the biology of natural mRNA modifications needs to be enhanced because there is a lot more knowledge unknown. Recently, there are an increased number of naturally occurring cellular mRNA modifications discovered within CDS, such as m 7 G \nWith regard to the delivery vectors, new lipid and polymer materials with high biocompatibility, high load efficiency, and low immunogenicity are critically needed. Of note, we should consider more about the mRNA/vector formulation strategies. Although the LNP formulation strategy represents the best choice in current stage to deliver synthetic mRNA, there is still much room for improvement. How to balance the requirements in circulation time of LNP, tissue-specific targeting, and efficient cellular uptake and endosomal release of cargo is still a complex pharmacology issue. More auxiliary elements such as specific cell-targeting and environment-responsive ligands probably need to be incorporated on the surface of LNP.\nFinally, the field of synthetic modified mRNA for therapeutic applications is gaining the momentum because of its great potentials. We have witnessed a remarkable progress in miscellaneous applications including infectious diseases vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, genetic reprogramming and protein replacement, and mRNA-based gene editing. The striking achievements are the two approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in which the mRNAs are m 1 -modified. Other therapeutic products are still in the preclinical or clinical stages and need a long-term validation of efficacy and safety. It is clear that some issues exist in many aspects of the real applications such as the design of modified mRNA constructs, scalable production and purification, the delivery system, immunogenicity, dosage, cell targeting selectivity, and cell transfection and cargo release efficiency.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become one of the most appealing and commonly used mRNA delivery tools.

However, drug delivery is not easily controlled. Drug release rates, cell-and tissue-specific targeting, and drug stability are difficult to predict.

Here, we define DDS as technologies that are designed to improve the specificity of therapeutics by stabilizing them in vivo, controlling their release, and localizing their effect. Many materials have released therapeutics for prolonged periods of time and at targeted locations within the body; the properties of DDS are tailored to the physicochemical attributes of the drug and the intended route of administration (Figure', metadata={'chunk_title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'doc_id': 9.0, 'file_name': 'Emerging Frontiers in Drug Delivery.txt'}), 0.806159914), (Document(page_content='DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR CONTROLLED\nRELEASE One important class of DDS is controlled release systems (CRS), which are engineered to deliver drugs for days to years with a predetermined release profile.

First, DDS efficacy is intimately related to the chemical structure of the material. For example, minor chemical modifications to polymer structure can drastically affect material degradation, safety, and targeting.

The presence of amino groups is responsible for the strong affinity to nucleic acids, including mRNA, and the cationic charges facilitate the interaction of the polyplexes with the cell membrane and the entry into the target cell.

The induction of a specific immune response by mRNA vaccines begins when the antigen is expressed in the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells or APCs (DCs or macrophages). The resulting proteins are processed by proteasomes and presented on MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells, activating cellular response \nAt present, there is a great number of clinical trials using in vivo or ex vivo mRNA based immunotherapy in various cancer types (Table \nRegardless of the strategy, mRNA vaccines can be designed to target a wide variety of antigens, including TAAs, cancer testis antigens (CTAs) and tumor-specific antigens (TSAs); all of them have been tested in clinical trials. TAAs derive from proteins that are overexpressed in cancer cells, but they also occur in normal cells. CTAs are a group of TAAs that might serve as ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their cancer-restricted expression and robust immunogenicity. TSAs derive from viral oncogenic proteins or from proteins produced, due to somatic mutations or gene rearrangements; tumors, in general, acquire mutations during carcinogenesis and progression, resulting in altered proteins that may serve as neoantigens \nApart from the use of IVT mRNA to produce a specific immune response, non-coding mRNA (CV8102) also has been tested clinically as an adjuvant. CV8102 is a TLR7/8/RIG-1 agonist based on noncoding single stranded RNA, designed to modulate the tumor microenvironment after intratumoral injection. It is being evaluated alone (NCT03291002) or in combination with IMA970A, which is a new cancer vaccine for primary liver cancer based on an off-the-shelf cocktail of 16 peptides (NCT03203005).  The first mRNA cancer vaccine was developed by \nBesides the delivery system, the administration route also has a significant influence on mRNA vaccine efficacy. Multiple administration approaches have been evaluated in clinical trials to target mRNA to APC cells, from conventional vaccination routes, such as intradermal, intramuscular and subcutaneous, to less common methods, such as intranodal, intravenous or intratumoral. Except for CAR T cells, intradermal route is the most widely used in both, in vivo and ex vivo approaches. Regarding in vivo delivery, CV9201 and CV9202 (NCT00923312 and NCT01915524), based on CureVac's RNActive ® technology, have been applied intradermally for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).

Up to date around 17 nucleic acid-based products have been approved worldwide, and almost 2700 gene therapy-based clinical trials have been completed, are ongoing or have been approved for a broad range of applications. It is expected that nucleic acid-based products will have a substantial impact on the biopharmaceutical market in the near future \nDepending on the final objective, gene therapy can be applied for gene augmentation, gene silencing, or gene editing \nThe specific features of synthetic mRNA make it a promising alternative to DNA based products.

It comprises a variety of complex processes that determine the intracellular disposition of the mRNA. The vectors are included in endosomes by the invagination of the cell membrane. Endosomes mature and fuse with lysosomes, where the acidic environment and the presence of hydrolytic enzymes can degrade the vector and the nucleic acid. Therefore, endosomal escape before degradation is considered a bottleneck for successful mRNA therapy, and, as in the case of cellular internalization, the delivery system plays a crucial role. The foremost proposed mechanisms of endosomal escape include endosome disruption, active transport, or fusion of the delivery system with the endosomal membrane \nThe present work reviews the strategies accomplished to optimize the functionality and efficacy of IVT mRNA. Besides the chemical modifications in its structure, the nanosystems and technological approaches developed for a successful IVT mRNA delivery will be described.

In HDR the nucleases act in the presence of a donor DNA template that contains a homologous sequence to be introduced into DSB. This repair is useful to correct genomic mutations or to insert new sequences encoding therapeutic proteins. NHEJ eliminates the target region by binding DSBs; it can be used to silence or correct an anomalous gene \nThere are three main types of gene editing nucleases, composed of a target-sequence-recognizing domain and a nuclease: ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9.\nZFNs are engineering by fusing zinc-finger DNA binding domains (Cys2-His2) with FokI nuclease as the DNA cleavage domain \nGene editing nucleases can be delivered in protein, pDNA or mRNA forms \nIVT mRNA encoding genome-editing nucleases has been mainly used ex vivo to edit T cells or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by electroporation for research and preclinical studies \nThe translation to clinic of mRNA-based gene editing is currently focused on ex vivo applications (Table \nTALEN-mRNA is used to generate UCART19, the first allogenic CAR T cell therapy in clinical study, in pediatric and adult relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NCT02808442, NCT02746952).

However, despite the successes, many challenges and unmet clinical needs remain. New classes of therapeutics (e.g., biologics) and administration demands (e.g., orally administered extended release devices and injectable materials for site-specific delivery) necessitate advanced DDS that protect sensitive molecules, specifically target diseased regions of the body, and release drugs over the course of months to treat chronic disease. Medicine is no longer limited to orally available formulations that require two or three times daily ingestion. We can now tackle pathology at the site of action, engaging biological mechanisms that underpin its origin to manage and reverse the progress of disease.\nThe emerging frontiers of drug delivery discussed in this paper have the potential for tremendous clinical impact in the coming decades. Systemic delivery of RNAs can treat disease at the genetic level, seeking out aberrant regions of the body and repairing their function at the most basic level. Injectable materials can localize therapeutics to the site of action in order to mitigate off-target toxicity and increase clinical effect. Oral delivery of biologics can increase the indication and impact of this growing field of therapeutics. Extended release devices delivered to the GI tract can aid in the management of chronic disease and avoid adherence issues. Finally, living systems can be re-engineered to work with the body, and not against, to treat disease using the outstanding delivery mechanisms of microvesicles, pathogens, and cells (e.g., selective targeting, prolonged circulation, and immune tolerance).\nIndeed, as therapeutics continue to improve, there will be a growing need for improved DDS. Materials will be required to control the delivery of gene editing technologies including CRISPR-Cas9, zinc-finger nucleases, and transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to ensure permanent modifications to the genetic code are localized to diseased cells. Chemical strategies for the safe delivery of gene editing technologies will require improved nucleic acid delivery, since the targeting RNA needs to be delivered concurrently with mRNA encoding the nuclease, and since this protein/RNA complex needs to form in the cytoplasm and migrate to the nucleus. Nucleic acid delivery will likely improve as we understand how biological pathways affect nanoparticle targeting and endosomal escape.', metadata={'chunk_title': 'CONCLUDING THOUGHTS', 'doc_id': 9.0, 'file_name': 'Emerging Frontiers in Drug Delivery.txt'}), 0.185701385)]",0

This enables the rational design of neoepitope cancer vaccines in a patient-specific manner, and has the advantage of targeting non-self antigen specificities that should not be eliminated by central tolerance mechanisms. Proof of concept has been recently provided: Kreiter and colleagues found that a substantial portion of non-synonymous cancer mutations were immunogenic when delivered by mRNA and were mainly recognized by CD4 + T cells 176 . On the basis of these data, they generated a computational method to predict major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted neoepitopes that can be used as vaccine immunogens. mRNA vaccines encoding such neoepitopes have controlled tumour growth in B16-F10 melanoma and CT26 colon cancer mouse models. In a recent clinical trial, Sahin and colleagues developed personalized neoepitope-based mRNA vaccines for 13 patients with metastatic melanoma, a cancer known for its high frequency of somatic mutations and thus neoepitopes. They immunized against ten neoepitopes per individual by injecting naked mRNA intranodally.

The nucleotides constitute the alphabet of the genetic code. Three consecutive nucleotides, for example, AUG, function as codons. Accordingly, by using four letters of the alphabet, A, C, G, and U, 64 different codons are possible. In general, codons define the amino acid which will be recruited next in the protein synthesis. On top of that, a single codon or groups of codons have specific functions, for example, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine and operates as the start codon for the coding part of the mRNA. Table \nThe task mRNA has to fulfil involves the following steps. It starts with the production of a single-strand copy of the genetic code laid down in the DNA, which is performed by RNA polymerase. This process is called transcription and leads to precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), which-via splicing procedures-finally becomes mature mRNA. In parallel to transcription, the 5 cap is added to the molecule and the poly(A) tail is attached at the end of the chain. After that, the mRNA is transported from the nucleus of the cell to the cytosol. Various mechanisms can be utilized for this step involving different proteins, such as CBP20 and CBP80. Subsequently, ribosomes take over, read the code, and start the protein synthesis according to the codons provided in the coding section of the mRNA. The synthesis is terminated as soon as a stop codon is reached. Stop codons are UAG (amber), UAA (ochre), and UGA (opal). Thereafter, the mRNA is degraded by ribonucleases. mRNA activates the innate immune response through various RNA sensors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and protein kinase R (PKR)', metadata={'chunk_title': 'Component', 'doc_id': 8.0, 'file_name': 'biomedicines-11-00308-v2.txt'}), 0.174177065)]",0
