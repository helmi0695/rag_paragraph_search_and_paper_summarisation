ABSTRACT
 The recent approval of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the potential of both conventional mRNA and self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) as a flexible immunotherapy platform to treat infectious diseases. Besides the antigen it encodes, mRNA itself has an immune-stimulating activity that can contribute to vaccine efficacy. This self-adjuvant effect, however, will interfere with mRNA translation and may influence the desired therapeutic outcome. To further exploit its potential as a versatile therapeutic platform, it will be crucial to control mRNA's innate immune-stimulating properties. In this regard, we describe the mechanisms behind the innate immune recognition of mRNA and provide an extensive overview of strategies to control its innate immunestimulating activity. These strategies range from modifications to the mRNA backbone itself, optimization of production and purification processes to the combination with innate immune inhibitors. Furthermore, we discuss the delicate balance of the self-adjuvant effect in mRNA vaccination strategies, which can be both beneficial and detrimental to the therapeutic outcome.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Introduction
The recent FDA approval of the first messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine formulations, developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, to control the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, created a new wave of attention for mRNA-based therapeutics 
Several concerns, such as extra-and intracellular instability, intracellular delivery and inherent immunogenicity, delayed the translation of mRNA therapeutics to the clinic. Over the last few years, substantial progress was made in the design of the mRNA molecule itself and the development of appropriate delivery vehicles to overcome these concerns 
A third but very important factor influencing the effect of mRNA therapeutics is the inherent innate immune-stimulating activity of mRNA, which can either support or hamper the therapeutic outcome. Non-immunotherapy-based applications suffer from this intrinsic innate immune stimulation as it induces an overall cellular antiviral state in most cell types, promoting mRNA degradation and inhibiting the translation process. On the contrary, vaccination purposes might benefit from additional innate immune stimulation. However, this concept is rather complex and mainly depends on finding the optimal balance between the different factors involved

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Conventional mRNA
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a fairly simple and relatively small single-stranded structure of around 1000 -5000 nucleotides. It is typically made up of five elements that are critical for its expression: a cap structure (m7GpppN), a 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR), an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the gene of interest (GOI) flanked by the start and stop codon, a 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) and a poly(A) tail at the 3 0 end of about 100 -250 adenosine residues. In living cells, mRNA is transcribed from DNA by RNA polymerase, spliced and subsequently transported from the nucleus to the cytosol. Then, the ribosomes are recruited, resulting in the direct but transient expression of the encoded protein, during the life span of the mRNA molecules (Fig. 
In analogy to naturally produced mRNA, synthetic mRNA is prepared by in vitro transcription (IVT) of a linearized plasmid DNA (pDNA) or PCR template containing the gene of interest and a promoter region for a bacteriophage T7, SP6 or T3 RNA polymerase. To start the IVT reaction, also the four ribonucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), a ribonuclease (RNase) inhibitor (to inactivate contaminating RNase), a pH buffer and Mg 2+ as co-factor for the RNA polymerase should be provided. The transcription is initiated by binding of RNA polymerase to its promoter sequence, after which it links ribonucleotides together as it moves along the DNA template to form the complementary mRNA strand. The RNA transcript is completed when the enzyme runs off at the end of the template (runoff transcription), ready for the next round. At the end, the DNA template is fragmented by treatment with a DNase and the produced mRNA is purified from the remaining reaction compounds, such as the RNA polymerase and the unincorporated NTPs 
The simplicity of the mRNA construct and its relatively small size compared to saRNA are key features promoting the use of conventional mRNA. Due to its short half-life and inherent instability, however, only low and transient protein production levels could be achieved. To date, remarkable improvements in mRNA translation efficiency and stability have been made through sequence optimization, the incorporation of chemically modified nucleosides, and several advanced purification strategies. Yet, protein expression remains proportional to the number of mRNA molecules successfully delivered to the cytosol of the cells and relatively high doses are often required to obtain significant therapeutic effects

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Self-amplifying mRNA
When compared to conventional, non-amplifying mRNA, saRNA is a more complex and considerably larger (9000 -12,000 nucleotides) structure as besides the basic elements found in an mRNA molecule (a cap, 5 0 UTR, an ORF with GOI, 3 0 UTR and poly(A) tail), saRNA also contains the coding sequences of a viral replicase complex, a genomic and a subgenomic (SG) promoter 
Unlike conventional mRNA, the GOI cannot be immediately translated from the originally delivered saRNA molecule upon entry in the host cell. As depicted in Fig. 
cleaved by nsP2 to generate the early replication complex (replicase), which consists of the nsP1-3 polyprotein and associated nsP4 (Fig. 
Due to its auto-replicative ability, a higher protein expression level can be maintained and also the duration of protein expression is significantly extended 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Innate immunity stimulation
Our innate immune system has evolved to recognize non-self molecules, such as viral single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA, initiating a series of signaling pathways to fight the pathogen. Both conventional mRNA and saRNA are potent activators of the innate immune system, leading to interferon (IFN) secretion which hampers RNA translation and promotes mRNA degradation 
Activation of the innate immune system can be initiated by stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) through binding with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The mRNA binding PRRs can be classified according to their cellular locations as the cytosolic PRRs and endosomal PRRs. In the cytosol, the PRRs include the nucleotide oligomerization domain like receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). In the endosomes, the PRRs are represented by the toll-like receptors (TLRs). Upon mRNA recognition, a complex series of interacting signaling pathways is initiated, eventually leading to the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines as presented in Fig. 2 
All TLRs which have been identified in humans, differ in their cellular location and ligand specificity. Endosomal mRNA-binding TLRs are TLR3, binding to dsRNA, and TLR7/8, which recognize uridine-rich ssRNA (Fig. 
Once type I IFNs are expressed, they are transported to the extracellular environment where they can react with interferona/b receptors (IFNARs) in an auto-or paracrine fashion (Fig. 
Upon expression of ISGs, several anti-viral responses can be initiated. Two important ISGs shown to be involved in this anti-viral responses upon dsRNA recognition, are dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2 0 -5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Strategies to control innate immune activation upon conventional and self-amplifying mRNA delivery
As described above, the innate immune-stimulating activity affects both the translation and integrity of conventional and self-amplifying mRNA. For non-immunotherapy applications, mRNA-induced immune stimulation is highly unwanted and should be avoided completely. In contrast, for vaccination applications, the situation is more ambiguous and mRNA-induced immune stimulation should rather be controlled than completely eliminated as discussed further in Section 5. Below, we will present an extensive overview of the strategies and methods that are currently being used to avoid or control the innate immunestimulating activity of mRNA and saRNA, as presented in Fig. 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Modifications to the mRNA backbone itself
The first strategy to limit mRNA-induced immunity, comprises the modifications on the level of the pDNA template or the IVT mRNA or saRNA molecule itself, as summarized in Fig. 
# FORMULA: 4.1.1. 5 0 cap
The 5 0 cap structure (m7GpppN) is a regular characteristic of eukaryotic mRNAs, including viral RNAs such as those from alphaviruses 
These cap structures can either be incorporated during the IVT production process of mRNA or saRNA (co-transcriptional capping) or after initial mRNA synthesis using recombinant vaccinia virusderived capping enzymes (post-transcriptional capping) 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Untranslated regions
The 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs in mRNA are important regulators of mRNA stability and translational efficiency 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Poly(A) tail
The 3 0 end of the conventional IVT mRNA or saRNA is decorated by a poly(A) tail, which plays a key role in regulating mRNA stability. A long poly(A) tail is known to have a stabilizing function and This figure indicates which adaptations can be made to each of these regions to suppress innate immune recognition. B) Optimizing in vitro transcription (IVT) production and purification of mRNA and saRNA. During IVT, immunogenic byproducts, including dsRNAs, are formed next to the desired mRNA strand. To limit the dsRNA amount and reduce innate immune stimulation, their formation during IVT can be prevented or they can be removed after IVT. C) Innate immune inhibitors. A concise overview is given of innate immune inhibitors that have been used to reduce innate immune stimulation upon mRNA and/or saRNA delivery.
naturally has a length of approximately 250 adenosine ribonucleotides in mammalian cells. In addition, the poly(A) tail is important for RNA translation by supporting the formation of a closedloop state, which also impedes deadenylation and mRNA degradation, through association of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) with both the poly(A) tail and the 5 0 cap 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Nucleoside base modifications
The use of modified nucleoside analogues is probably the most applied approach to prevent IVT mRNA from intracellular recognition by PRRs and consequently evade innate immunity. To date, 143 modified nucleosides have been characterized in endogenous RNAs and differences in nucleoside modifications can enable PRRs to detect foreign RNA of invading pathogens 
Pioneering work in this area was done by Karikó et al. who demonstrated in primary dendritic cells (DCs) that upon mRNA transfection, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8 activation could be reduced or completely eliminated with mRNA containing the following modifications either separately or in combination: 5-methylcytidine (m5C), N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), 5-methyluridine (m5U), 2thiouridine (s2U) or pseudouridine (W) 
Although these findings suggest that mRNA modification is an inevitable prerequisite for the development of non-immunogenic, mRNA-based protein therapies, some other studies have been published that contradict this approach. For example, researchers of CureVac demonstrated that W incorporation in sequenceoptimized (Section 4.1.5), HPLC-purified (Section 4.2.3) mRNA reduced protein expression in HeLa cells and in mice after lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery. In contrast, when the mRNA sequence was not optimized, W substitution did enhance protein production 
In accordance with conventional IVT mRNA, also IVT saRNA is recognized as foreign by innate immune sensors. However, in contrast to conventional mRNA, the usage of modified nucleosides is not considered as an option to reduce its immune-stimulating activity. The effect of incorporating modified nucleosides into saRNA would already be lost after the first round of amplification. Moreover, it is expected to impair the self-replicating capacity of saRNA in the target cells 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Open reading frame
So far, we have discussed adaptations to the cap structure, UTRs, poly(A) tail and nucleotides of the IVT mRNA, but an important missing element in this overview is the ORF. This protein encoding region of conventional mRNA can be modified through codon optimization, in which rare codons are replaced by frequently used synonymous ones that have abundant cognate tRNA in the cytosol without altering the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Codon optimization is applied to increase mRNA stability and translation efficiency, but cannot be applied in general for mRNA-based therapeutics, as some proteins require slow translation for their proper folding, which is ensured by less frequent codons 
In contrast to codon optimization, the following adaptation clearly affects the immune-stimulating activity of IVT conventional mRNA. The immunogenicity of IVT mRNA can be eliminated by minimizing or completely eliminating uridine content, as uridine-rich regions are known potent activators of several RNA sensors, including TLR7, TLR8 and RIG-I 
Distinct from conventional mRNA, the ORF of saRNA encodes four, viral nsPs essential for its self-replicating capacity. These nsPs are important controlling elements with regard to the saRNA biology and the host cell response 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: mRNA secondary structures
Lastly, in several parts of the mRNA or saRNA, including the UTRs and the ORF, the mRNA secondary structure can have a significant impact on mRNA translation and immune-stimulating activity 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Prevention of immunogenic dsRNA byproduct formation during IVT
Recent studies revealed two main mechanisms through which dsRNA byproducts are formed. Both are based on aberrant activity of the RNA polymerase besides its normal function as DNAdependent RNA polymerase, transcribing mRNA from a pDNA template. First of all, T7 RNA polymerase has an obscure RNAdependent RNA polymerase activity 
In a recent study, Mu et al. showed that for a few specific templates the formation of dsRNA species can be reduced during IVT by lowering Mg 2+ concentrations or by using modified nucleosides 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Removal of dsRNA byproducts from IVT mRNA and saRNA
An alternative approach to reduce the number of dsRNA contaminants is to eliminate dsRNA byproducts after completion of the IVT reaction. The vast majority of known purification techniques for mRNA and saRNA as mentioned in Section 4.2.1 are ineffective in the removal of dsRNAs. In this context, a major breakthrough was achieved when Karikó and colleagues reported that dsRNA impurities could be eliminated from IVT mRNA by ion pair reversed-phase HPLC based on the longer retention time of dsRNAs. They demonstrated that reversed-phase HPLC purification eliminated the residual immune stimulating activity of Wor m5C/W-modified mRNA, rendering a completely nonimmunogenic mRNA. In addition, reversed-phase HPLC purification of both modified and unmodified mRNA improved protein production significantly in primary cells 
Of interest, Baiersdörfer et al. reported on a cellulose-based chromatographic method that removes at least 90% of the dsRNA contaminants, based on the selective binding of dsRNA to cellulose in an ethanol-containing buffer. This new purification method is similarly effective to remove dsRNA contaminants as reversedphase HPLC, but on the contrary is fast, cost effective, scalable and has a relatively high recovery rate between 65% and 85%. Upon cellulose-based chromatography, m1W-containing IVT mRNA no longer induced IFN-a secretion in vivo when injected intravenously as lipoplex. In addition, elimination of dsRNA byproducts by cellulose-based purification showed to increase the in vivo translatability of IVT mRNA to a similar extent as reversed-phase HPLC purification, suggesting that these methods are equally effective and interchangeable for the removal of dsRNA contaminants from conventional IVT mRNA 
A third and last strategy to eliminate dsRNA byproducts after completion of the IVT reaction, is treatment of mRNA with RNase III, which specifically recognizes and cleaves dsRNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length. A recent in vivo study showed an improvement in cytotoxic killing of leukemia cells by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells generated with IVT mRNA, which was digested with RNase III 
In contrast to conventional mRNA, saRNA cannot be purified from dsRNAs by ion pair reversed-phase HPLC, as shear forces would cause the longer saRNA to break. On the contrary, cellulose-based chromatography of saRNA has already been reported to efficiently remove dsRNA byproducts from saRNA in a recent study by Zhong and colleagues. They demonstrated that cellulose purified saRNA elicited a significantly lower type I IFN response in IFN-b reporter mice after intradermal electroporation in comparison to saRNA purified on silica-based columns, which was however not reflected by an increase in protein translation. Nevertheless, a clear improvement in efficiency of a saRNA vaccine against Zika virus was noticed, characterized by a triplication in antibody titers, a doubling of the cellular immune responses and an increase in seroconversion rate from 62,5% to 100%

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Innate immune inhibitors
As mentioned above, several backbone modifications to reduce innate immune stimulation, including nucleoside base modification and sequence alteration, cannot be applied for saRNA, as this would interfere with its functionality. Also for conventional mRNA, nucleoside modifications could possibly alter mRNA secondary structures, translation and protein folding. Therefore, the use of innate immune inhibitors is gaining attention to modulate the immune-stimulating activity of both conventional and selfamplifying mRNA (Fig. 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Viral immune evasion mechanisms
Viruses have developed a plethora of intelligent mechanisms to avoid recognition and killing by the host's immune system, such as evading PRR detection, inhibiting IFN mediated effects and hampering cytokine function 
B18R is a 60-65 kDa glycoprotein encoded by the Western Reserve strain of the VVs and acts as a decoy receptor to neutralize type I IFNs (Fig. 
It should be noted that the beneficial effect of B18R on cell viability could not be replicated by both Gomez et al. and Minnaert et al. 
Besides B18R, two other VV proteins, E3 and K3, have been tested to block innate immune response activation during mRNA transfections, although their precise mode of action remains elusive. The 25 kDa protein E3 is suggested to act primarily by dsRNA binding, thereby preventing activation of anti-viral state pathways, and direct PKR inhibition which hampers homodimerization (Fig. 
Poleganov et al. delivered non-modified mRNA encoding for the immune evasion proteins B18R, E3 and K3 together with nonmodified mRNA encoding for different reprogramming factors, to Human Foreskin Fibroblast (HFF) cells. The authors observed a three-fold increase in protein expression mediated by E3 and K3 mRNA delivery, which further increased to 4.6-fold upon the additional delivery of B18R mRNA, despite the fact that B18R mRNA alone remained without effect. Consequently, the authors measured an 80% decrease in IFN-b secretion due to E3 and K3, which even further reduced upon addition of B18R mRNA or the B18R protein. Additionally, the addition of the immune evasion proteins also prevented cell death upon multiple mRNA transfections 
Taken together, the different VV proteins described above all show potential as innate immune inhibitors to enhance treatment efficiency both in terms of cell viability or protein expression. Future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved and to determine in vivo effects more in detail will provide insight about their future clinical potential.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Influenza A virus proteins: NS1 and PB1-F2.
The influenza A virus (IAV) belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae virus family and is a single-stranded RNA virus, consisting of eight RNA segments. Similar to VVs, several mechanisms have been developed by the IAVs to evade the innate immune response, including the expression of proteins, which might inhibit triggers and signaling pathways of the innate immunity. Below, we will discuss two noteworthy non-structural IAV proteins and their influence on innate immunity 
The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is encoded by the eighth mRNA segment of the influenza A virus and consists of both an RNA binding domain and an effector domain. Innate immune signaling is prevented through several mechanisms depending on the virus strain of origin including inhibition of IRF3, direct PKR inhibition and OAS inhibition by dsRNA binding (Fig. 
A second potentially interesting non-structural IAV protein is PB1-F2, which has been linked to several effects such as type I IFN response suppression. However, most of the effects seem to be virus strain dependent. Although Le Goffic et al. described an increase in type I IFN activity mediated by PB1-F2, several more recent studies have contradicted this observation

TITLE PARAGRAPH: MERS-CoV
ORF4a and PIV-5V self-amplifying mRNA inhibitors. The studies described above demonstrate that applying two different mRNAs, i.e. encoding the protein of interest on the one hand and the immune inhibitor on the other, has shown good potential to reduce IVT mRNA-induced innate immune responses. However, the fact that cells have to receive both mRNA formulations remains a difficulty. Recently, Blakney et al. provided an interesting alternative to overcome this hurdle. They established saRNA constructs containing coding regions for both the POI and an innate immune inhibitor. An in vitro screen of several different inhibitors encoded by the saRNA showed the superiority of the MERS-CoV ORF4a and PIV-5 V protein in different human cell lines. The MERS-CoV ORF4a protein binds to dsRNA, which hampers PACT activation of the RIG-I and MDA-5 receptors, while the PIV-5 V protein binds to MDA-5 directly. As such, these proteins could possibly interfere with IFN production. The mechanism of increased protein expression was studied in MRC5 cells and they indeed found a decrease of NF-jB and IRF3 in the early stages upon transfection. The in vitro results were however not confirmed in vivo, as neither of the proteins led to a substantial and significant increase in protein expression in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, both proteins were able to increase the percentage of transfected cells in human skin explants

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Non-viral immune evasion mechanisms
Besides the use of viral immune evasions proteins, many other non-viral molecules have been tested for their potential to reduce immune responses and increase protein expression, of which we will provide a selection below. 4.3.2.1. RNA Interference-mediated immune suppression. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are short dsRNA sequences that can be designed to silence any gene in a sequence specific manner 
Also the integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB), a molecule capable of enhancing translation by improving eIF2B complex formation, demonstrated to enhance protein expression in the early transfection stages (0-6 h) upon luciferase mRNA delivery 
Taken together, the use of viral and non-viral innate immune inhibitors is an interesting strategy to consider during the development of mRNA-based therapeutics for different applications. The inhibitors can be used as an adjuvant to self-amplifying mRNA, modified and unmodified conventional mRNA. Moreover, they can provide an added value when multiple mRNA transfections are required, for instance with cellular reprogramming. Finally, inhibitors can be delivered as soluble proteins or as mRNA constructs, possibly co-encapsulated with the therapeutic mRNA in a nanoparticle carrier. However, which inhibitor should be selected and how it should be used is cell type and therapy dependent.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: mRNA vaccines
Vaccines can prevent against a variety of infectious diseases, by priming the immune system which is then able to recognize and destroy the pathogen upon future encounter. Most of the current vaccines are based on attenuated or inactivated pathogens, or recombinant produced antigens. Over the recent years, many researchers have recognized the advantages of conventional and self-amplifying mRNA-based vaccines for both infectious diseases and cancer treatment 
As outlined in Section 3, type I IFNs and many other proteins, encoded by ISGs are produced upon the cellular entrance of synthetic mRNA by activation of PRR signaling pathways 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Type I IFN-mediated effects: Beneficial or detrimental for mRNA vaccines?
A first requirement for sufficient mRNA vaccine efficiency is that the antigen expression needs to reach the antigenic threshold for T cell and B cell activation 
In the context of the development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, the focus was laid on the generation of neutralizing antibody responses against the SARS-COV-2 Spike glycoprotein 
In contrast, the use of ''immunogenic" unmodified mRNA has been the preferred choice in the design of mRNA vaccines for cancer vaccination, where the main focus is to elicit cytotoxic CD8 + T cell responses to eliminate tumor cells 
The impact of type I IFN signaling on the vaccine outcome was shown to be different for saRNA vaccines. The antigen expression kinetics from saRNA differs from conventional mRNA, as it is preceded by the translation of the replicase complex and as it is more intense and long lasting 
IgG anti-RSV F antibody titer 
It should be noted that the different experimental conditions used in the many, sometimes contradictory, studies available make it difficult to compare results with one another. It has however been suggested that the amount of type I IFN secretion as well as the timing of type I IFN signaling are crucial for the final outcome 

----

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Adjuvant therapies
All things considered, both antigen expression and innate immune stimulation are crucial for the vaccine efficiency 
As mentioned above, the use of modified uridines can improve the intracellular mRNA stability and translation efficiency by reduction of PRR signaling, but can also come at a cost of T cell priming and functioning 
Taken together, mRNA vaccine development is all about achieving optimal contribution of the different elements involved. Researchers agree that several aspects such as administration route, mRNA design and formulation, cell type, and translation from animals to humans will define which pathways and effects are triggered

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Conclusions
During the last decade, important investments have been made in the research and development of mRNA-and saRNA-based therapeutics. Up till now, most preclinical and clinical reports on mRNA therapeutics focus on its potential for vaccination purposes against infectious diseases and cancer, but the IVT mRNA platform is assumed to be versatile and promising for other applications as well, including protein replacement therapy, gene editing, and cell fate determination and reprogramming. Although the applications are very diverse, some common hurdles should be taken into account in order to fully exploit their potential as therapeutics. In this review, we focus on one of these hurdles and discuss in depth the immune-stimulatory properties of IVT mRNA and saRNA.
It is important to realize that the therapeutic outcome of mRNA-and saRNA-based therapies can either benefit or suffer from RNA-induced immune stimulation depending on the treatment application. For non-immunotherapy applications, we can unambiguously state that mRNA-induced immune stimulation should be avoided. Moreover, the induced innate immune response is highly unfavorable for frequent mRNA administration, which might be required for protein replacement therapies and mRNAbased cell reprogramming protocols. In contrast, for vaccination approaches, the situation is more complex and not fully elucidated yet. Here, it will be crucial but challenging to find a balance between the negative impact of the induced type I IFNs on antigen expression and RNA amplification on the one hand, and the potential of type I IFNs to instigate B and T cell responses on the other making the mRNA to become its own adjuvant. Moreover, conflicting reports regarding the influence of type I IFNs on CD8 + T cell responses further increase complexity.
Consequently, a variety of strategies have been explored to control the innate immune response elicited by mRNA-and saRNAbased therapeutics and more in-depth research is still ongoing. The vast majority of studies on this topic investigate mRNAbased therapeutics, whereas only a few solely focus on reducing the innate immunogenicity of saRNA. To us this is not surprising because up till now, except for some saRNA-mediated cell reprogramming studies, the use of saRNA was restricted to vaccination approaches in which the self-adjuvant properties of saRNA were considered as an important benefit for vaccine potency. However, nowadays, it is generally realized that controlling the innate immune response to saRNA is of vital importance to obtain effective and safe saRNA-based vaccines in the end, and therefore researchers started looking into strategies to modulate the innate immune response to saRNA. Furthermore, if saRNA-based therapeutics would be explored in the future for other nonimmunotherapy approaches, it will be even more crucial to reduce its immune-stimulating activity.
Currently, the methods that have been applied to limit the immune-stimulatory activity of IVT mRNA and saRNA can be divided into three main categories. Firstly, every element of the mRNA or saRNA backbone itself can be altered, which is a very convenient strategy to optimize its stability and to evade innate immune stimulation directly or indirectly. In this regard, the most frequently applied and successful approach is the incorporation of modified nucleosides. However, caution should be taken because conflicting studies report that incorporation of modified nucleosides did not impact or even negatively impacted protein expression. Once again, this highlights the complexity and shows that variations in delivery system, administration route, target cell and mRNA properties may also affect the evoked innate immune response. Secondly, there is no doubt that proper production and purification of the mRNA or saRNA are essential requirements to obtain a safe and effective end product, free of immunogenic byproducts such as short abortive RNA transcripts and dsRNAs. Thirdly, both conventional and self-replicating mRNA delivery can be combined with innate immune inhibitors to quell its immune-stimulating activity. This approach is an attractive alternative to other rather time consuming and expensive approaches described above. In addition, to retain saRNA functionality, neither nucleoside modification nor sequence alteration is tolerated, which increases the interest in the use of innate immune inhibitors. Both for mRNA and saRNA, promising results were obtained already in multiple studies with a variety of inhibitors, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation. However, it is important to realize that the choice of inhibitor is also depending on the target cell type and the treatment application, which complicates the identification of innate immune inhibitors that might be applied universally for mRNA-and saRNA-based therapeutics.
It is clear that the mRNA-or saRNA-mediated innate immune response is a complex interplay of many factors, like the mRNA properties, target cell, the delivery vehicle and the administration route, which define the fate of the mRNA. The immunestimulating activity of the carrier itself is often overlooked and future research on this topic would be of interest. Since many different players are involved in the innate immunity signaling pathway itself, it is not surprising that reducing the innate immunestimulating activity of mRNA and saRNA is not straightforward and none of the methods described in this review can be regarded as the golden standard to achieve this goal. Moreover, a combination of different strategies will be typically required to modulate the innate immunogenicity of mRNA and saRNA according to the desired application. In conclusion, although numerous efforts have been made already with regard to innate immune sensing of mRNA and saRNA, there are still knowledge gaps requiring further research and head-to-head comparisons between mRNA platforms. We believe that progress in this field will be made soon, as the recent marketing of the mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioN-Tech and Moderna is an ultimate boost for the research and development of numerous other mRNA-and saRNA-based therapeutics.
