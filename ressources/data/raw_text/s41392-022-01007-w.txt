ABSTRACT
 The therapeutic use of messenger RNA (mRNA) has fueled great hope to combat a wide range of incurable diseases. Recent rapid advances in biotechnology and molecular medicine have enabled the production of almost any functional protein/peptide in the human body by introducing mRNA as a vaccine or therapeutic agent. This represents a rising precision medicine field with great promise for preventing and treating many intractable or genetic diseases. In addition, in vitro transcribed mRNA has achieved programmed production, which is more effective, faster in design and production, as well as more flexible and cost-effective than conventional approaches that may offer. Based on these extraordinary advantages, mRNA vaccines have the characteristics of the swiftest response to large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the currently devastating pandemic COVID-19. It has always been the scientists' desire to improve the stability, immunogenicity, translation efficiency, and delivery system to achieve efficient and safe delivery of mRNA. Excitingly, these scientific dreams have gradually been realized with the rapid, amazing achievements of molecular biology, RNA technology, vaccinology, and nanotechnology. In this review, we comprehensively describe mRNA-based therapeutics, including their principles, manufacture, application, effects, and shortcomings. We also highlight the importance of mRNA optimization and delivery systems in successful mRNA therapeutics and discuss the key challenges and opportunities in developing these tools into powerful and versatile tools to combat many genetic, infectious, cancer, and other refractory diseases.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: INTRODUCTION
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a type of single-stranded ribonucleic acid that is transcribed from a strand of DNA, which carries the coding information for protein synthesis to be further transcribed and processed into functional proteins. 
Nevertheless, insufficient knowledge of mRNA structure instability and immunogenicity has dampened some of the promises and impeded the pace of mRNA-based therapeutics to combat diseases. 
Our lab has been committed to promoting mRNA-based therapeutics to become powerful and versatile tools to combat diseases, especially in gene therapy and immunotherapy.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: MRNA DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
The development of mRNA-based therapeutics mainly includes mRNA design, synthesis, mRNA entrapment, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety evaluation in vivo and in vitro, manufacturing, and clinical trials (Fig. 
The structural elements of mRNA mRNA is produced by the transcription process. The precursor mRNA is synthesized in eukaryotes when RNA polymerase converts genes into primary mRNA transcripts in vivo, which usually still contains noncoding sequence introns, and are further removed to become mature mRNA by mRNA processing, including 5′ mRNA capping, modifications, splicing, and A-to-I editing. 
Trepotec et al. designed a series of short 5′-UTRs by inserting or altering less than two ribonucleosides based on the Kozak sequence. Two short 5′-UTRs were either better or equally effective than the human alpha globin 5′-UTR.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: RNA chemical formula design
Self-amplifying RNA: Compared to conventional mRNA, selfamplifying RNA (saRNA) is another kind of mRNA molecule with a different structure. 
The basic elements of saRNA are the 5′ cap, 5′-UTR, sequence coding for nsP1-4, subgenomic promoter sequence, ORF with GOI, 3′-UTR, and 3′ poly(A) tail. 
Circular RNA, noncoding RNAs, and competitive endogenous RNA: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded, covalently closed RNA molecules that are ubiquitous in species ranging from viruses to mammals. CircRNAs, act as protein decoys, scaffolds and recruiters, exert biological functions by acting as transcriptional regulators, microRNA sponges, and protein templates. CircRNA is generated by back-splicing, in which the 3′-end of an exon ligates to the 5′-end of its own or an upstream exon through a 3′,5′phosphodiester bond, forming a closed structure.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: MRNA DELIVERY SYSTEMS
Researchers initially demonstrated a negative attitude to the therapeutic potential of mRNA due to its instability in early explorations.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Lipid nanoparticles
Cationic lipid nanoparticles. Cationic lipids have been broadly used in mRNA delivery, including N- [1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N, N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3trimethylammonium propane chloride (DOTAP), 1,2-stearoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane (DSTAP), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DMTAP).

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Cationic nanoemulsion
CNEs were proposed as a potential nucleic acid delivery system in 1990 187 and thus far have been proven to effectively deliver nucleic acids for the treatment of various diseases. The addition of cationic lipids to the formulation is essential for nucleic acid complexation through electrostatic interactions, which is also essential to improve the stability and transfection efficiency of nucleic acids and protect them from degradation by nucleases. 
In vitro and in vivo barriers to mRNA delivery It has always been the focus of our thinking by increasing cell uptake, facilitating lysosomal escape, and speeding up translation to maximize the availability of mRNA. 
It is a prerequisite for efficient mRNA delivery to comprehend the mechanism of mRNA cellular uptake. It has been reported that naked mRNA is internalized by scavenger receptors without delivery materials and subsequently accumulates in lysosomes; minimally, mRNA escapes into the cytosol and expresses proteins, so it is necessary to use vectors for the intracellular delivery of mRNA and overcome the initial energy barrier to mRNA uptake. 
There is also a substantial challenge for mRNA delivery in vivo. 
The in vitro and in vivo efficiency of mRNA drugs is not always consistent. The transfection efficiency of alkyne lipids outperformed MC3, cKK-E12, and C12-200 in vitro but not in vivo. 
Tissue-targeted delivery of mRNA-based therapeutics is essential for efficient in vivo delivery of mRNA. 
APPLICATION mRNA-based therapeutics are expected to become a powerful therapy for a variety of refractory diseases, including infectious diseases, metabolic genetic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and other diseases (Fig. 
mRNA therapeutics that are directly based on the encoding molecules The aforementioned mRNA-based immunotherapy achieves promising outcomes by expressing antigens and then initiating immune responses, 245 which is defined as an indirect therapy that does not target the virus or tumor cells with mRNA encoding therapeutic proteins. 246 mRNAs encoding proteins/peptides directly target viruses, bacteria, or cancer cells. In contrast, mRNA therapeutics directly treating diseases by delivering mRNA-based functional proteins are considered a direct strategy, including missing or downregulated endogenous proteins, functional foreign proteins or antibodies, and proteins for gene editing tools. 
mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines: SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 268 and then caused pandemics worldwide. 
Influenza virus mRNA vaccine: Nachbagauer et al. selected the conserved HA stalk domain, matrix-2 ion channel, nucleoprotein, and broadly reactive neuraminidase as antigens to provide universal protection against the influenza virus. The vaccines used LNP to deliver m1Ψ mRNA and protected mice from challenge with H1N1 virus at 500-fold the median lethal dose (intradermally, an ionizable cationic lipid/phosphatidylcholine/ cholesterol/PEG-lipid (50:10:38.5:1.5 mol/mol)). 
Melanoma: Three non-DC-based and seven DC-based mRNA vaccines have been tested clinically. Among them, one non-DCbased 360 and one DC-based mRNA vaccine 361 used complete mRNAs from tumor cells, and other vaccines selected TAAs and encoded them into mRNAs. Notably, all DC-based mRNA vaccines failed to significantly improve clinical outcome in metastatic melanoma patients, and more than half of the participants developed disease progression during clinical trials, and intranodal (i.n.) vaccination failed to improve the efficacy of DC-based mRNA vaccines and had a lower response rate than i.d. vaccination (NCT01278940). 
Glioblastoma: mRNA vaccination has been considered a promising strategy to treat glioblastoma. 368 DC-based mRNA vaccines were generated by using mRNA copies of glioblastoma in patients and prolonged progression-free survival 2.9 times compared with matched controls (NCT00961844). 
have not yet been announced).
Acute myeloid leukemia: Two DC-based mRNA vaccines have been developed to reduce the relapse risk of AML patients with complete remission (NCT00510133 and NCT00965224). Electroporation DCs with WT1 mRNAs improved relapse-free survival in vaccination responders compared with nonresponders. Another study exploited mRNA encoding human telomerase reverse transcriptase, and i.d. vaccinations resulted in 11 of 19 patients in complete remission with a 52-month median follow-up. 
The safety of mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines have sufficient safety with good tolerance, and their adverse events (AEs) are generally mild to moderate, including injection site reactions such as pain, swelling, erythema, and influenza-like illnesses such as fatigue, myalgia, pyrexia, and chills. 
Recently, an anionic poly I:C-derived double-stranded RNA adjuvant was complexed with chitosan to synthesize polyplexes to stimulate DC maturation, promote antigen presentation, and initiate cytotoxic T cells, which showed certain therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment. 
mRNA-based protein replacement therapies. Protein replacement treatment has an extensive application in replacing missing or defective proteins with favorable proteins. 
mRNA-based T lymphocyte therapeutics: T lymphocytes are an intriguing target for their tremendous potential against cancer and infectious diseases, and electroporation is the main way to transform endonuclease-encoding mRNA into T cells in vitro. 
Moreover, researchers disrupted the TRAC gene to avoid graftversus-host reactions. 
Robust antitumor efficacy was demonstrated in a human disseminated mesothelioma xenograft model with multiple injections. 
Ex vivo delivery of mRNA to stem cells has been explored for various purposes. Electroporation was used to transfer mRNA encoding EGFP into mesenchymal stem cells and H9 human embryonic stem (H9 hES) cells, both of which achieved 90% transgene efficiency. 
Combination therapeutics based on mRNA drugs. Recently, combined therapeutics have emerged as a powerful modality to treat malignancy, contributing to synergetic efficacy. 503 ICB, 504 CAR T cells 265 and cancer vaccines are three important immunotherapies for cancer treatment. ICBs can release the brake of T cell activation and function, 504 but durable clinical benefit is only achieved in a minority of patients.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
mRNA-based therapeutics have made great strides, achieving remarkable improvement in mRNA stability, function, and production during the past 30 years. 2 mRNA drugs exploit cells as factories for antigen or functional protein production with promising efficacy and sufficient safety. 
In recent decades, especially the last few years, we have witnessed great scientific advances in mRNA-based therapeutics. Current clinical efforts encompassing mRNA-based drugs are directed toward infectious disease vaccines, cancer immunotherapies, therapeutic protein replacement therapies, and genetic disease treatment. Opportunities and challenges in mRNA-based therapeutics coexist, and there are a large number of questions requiring clarification. (

DESCRIPTION TABLE: 352,385  Notably, it seems that i.d. vaccination has a higher AE frequency than i.m. administration: CV7201 caused 7 of 10 grade 3 AEs in the i.d. groups (64 participants), only 3 AEs in the i. m. group (37 participants). 330 mRNA vaccines are a practical platform to improve the safety of vaccines by changing antigen sequences and modifying protein structures. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a phenomenon in which preexisting antibodies promote viral infection of host cells and lead to increased virulence. 386 mRNA encoding an E protein mutation without a conserved fusion-loop epitope was employed to enhance the safety of the anti-Zika mRNA vaccine and avoid potential ADE risk.387  Furthermore, mRNA encoding the RBD instead of its parental protein reduced the harmful immune response induced by vaccines.388    
Adjuvants for mRNA vaccines. Adjuvants are essential for mRNA-||
based therapeutics, especially mRNA vaccines, which can amplify||
and direct immune responses and modulate the magnitude and||
type of certain subsets of T helper, IgG subclasses, or mucosal||
antibody responses. There are a few adjuvants approved by the||
FDA for use in humans, including aluminum salts, MF59, AS01,||
AS03, AS04, and CpG 10181. 389 For mRNA vaccines, the sources of||
adjuvants mainly include the following five categories: (1) the self-||
adjuvant efficacy of IVT mRNA; (2) the immune-activating protein||
encoded by the mRNA (e.g., CD70, CD40 L and TriMix-DC); (3)||
direct-acting adjuvants: pathogen-associated molecular patterns||
and danger-associated molecular patterns (e.g., TLRs, helicases,||
NODs, and inflammasome agonists); (||
