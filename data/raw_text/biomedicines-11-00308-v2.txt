ABSTRACT
 This review provides an overview covering mRNA from its use in the COVID-19 pandemic to cancer immunotherapy, starting from the selection of appropriate antigens, tumor-associated and tumor-specific antigens, neoantigens, the basics of optimizing the mRNA molecule in terms of stability, efficacy, and tolerability, choosing the best formulation and the optimal route of administration, to summarizing current clinical trials of mRNA vaccines in tumor therapy.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Introduction
mRNA-messenger ribonucleic acid-is a single-strand copy of a selected part of the genetic sequence of a gene, negatively charged with secondary and tertiary structure formations. It is produced from DNA and-after appropriate modification-leads to the synthesis of a specific protein by a ribosome. It was first described in 1961

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Component
Nucleotides Function mRNA is composed of nucleotide building blocks consisting of a selection of four different nucleobases, adenine, cystine, guanine, and uracil, coupled to ribose which contains a phosphate group as the linker to the next nucleotide. mRNA transfers the genetic information for the synthesis of a specific protein from the genes via the DNA to the protein production facility: the ribosome. The nucleotides constitute the alphabet of the genetic code. Three consecutive nucleotides, for example, AUG, function as codons. Accordingly, by using four letters of the alphabet, A, C, G, and U, 64 different codons are possible. In general, codons define the amino acid which will be recruited next in the protein synthesis. On top of that, a single codon or groups of codons have specific functions, for example, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine and operates as the start codon for the coding part of the mRNA. Table 
The task mRNA has to fulfil involves the following steps. It starts with the production of a single-strand copy of the genetic code laid down in the DNA, which is performed by RNA polymerase. This process is called transcription and leads to precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), which-via splicing procedures-finally becomes mature mRNA. In parallel to transcription, the 5 cap is added to the molecule and the poly(A) tail is attached at the end of the chain. After that, the mRNA is transported from the nucleus of the cell to the cytosol. Various mechanisms can be utilized for this step involving different proteins, such as CBP20 and CBP80. Subsequently, ribosomes take over, read the code, and start the protein synthesis according to the codons provided in the coding section of the mRNA. The synthesis is terminated as soon as a stop codon is reached. Stop codons are UAG (amber), UAA (ochre), and UGA (opal). Thereafter, the mRNA is degraded by ribonucleases. mRNA activates the innate immune response through various RNA sensors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and protein kinase R (PKR)

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Lessons Learned from COVID-19
The unprecedented speed of the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, resulted in an extremely rapid development of mRNA vaccines 
Although SARS viruses are common in humans, vaccines had not been developed since the course of the infection normally was very mild. The SARS outbreak in early 2000 triggered DNA vaccine development

TITLE PARAGRAPH: •
Allows incorporation of cap1 at the 5 end of any mRNA and does not limit the concentration of any of the four nucleotides 
mRNA which encodes the protein of interest, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, can be administered as such or as self-replicating or self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) 
mRNA vaccines are different from classic viral vaccines by providing, instead of the antigen itself, the genetic information for producing the antigen. Now, it is up to the host to start protein production. This is a huge benefit compared to administering the antigen to the host. No longer are cell lines required with their potential to produce multiple impurities and the consequence to establish tedious purification and quality control procedures. This is the same issue for DNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines have another significant advantage over DNA vaccines. They have one major hurdle less. DNA needs to enter the cell nucleus 
Vaccine mRNA manufacturing is rapid and cheap by using an IVT from a DNA template with T7 RNA polymerase 
mRNA is a large hydrophilic, negatively charged molecule with secondary and tertiary structure formations. The cell membranes are negatively charged as well. Additionally, ion pumps and ion channels maintain a negative potential (-40 to -80 mV) across the cell membrane, keeping the cytosol negatively charged by controlling the balance of most of the essential metal ions (for example, K + , Na + , Ca 2+ , and Mg 2+ ). Naked mRNA is therefore not able to pass this barrier 
Although the mRNA molecule itself is chemically very stable in the dry state, it is rather unstable in the solution, and, moreover, is rapidly degraded by extracellular and intracellular exo-and endo-ribonucleases 
Most mRNA vaccines use lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as the carrier with a particle size between 1 and 100 nm. LNP formulations are composed of an ionizable or cationic lipid, a helper phospholipid, cholesterol or a cholesterol derivative, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipid. The purpose of the ionizable or cationic lipid is an interaction with the negatively charged mRNA. Examples are DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) 
In addition to LNP, other types of formulations such as liposomes 
The approved SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines use intramuscular (i.m.) administration. During their development, alternative injection routes have been evaluated, for example, intradermal application. A general consensus on what is the best route has not yet been achieved 
Another important issue of mRNA vaccines, which had to be addressed carefully, is manufacturing. A major lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is that synthesis of the active ingredient is simple because it is cell-free, scalable, and cost effective. Large-scale production of mRNA vaccines consists of a 1-or 2-step in vitro reaction followed by a purification platform with multiple steps that can include DNase digestion, precipitation, chromatography, or tangential flow filtration 
The lessons to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding mRNA vaccines are the following. The pandemic was the strongest driver possible for speeding up the development, production, and distribution of vaccines by providing more than necessary funding options and an immense public pressure to find solutions. Furthermore, mRNA is the ideal candidate for a vaccine since the target antigen is specific for the virus and-so far-has been rather stable regarding evading mutations. If the antigen should slip away, the development of new vaccines is rather straightforward and quick to establish from modifying the mRNA to manufacturing the final product. A still-unresolved issue is the storage temperature, which means freezing, in the case of Comirnaty at -90 • C to -60 • C and for Spikevax at -50 • C to -15 • C during storage and transport, which makes distribution rather cumbersome, in particular in hot areas such as Africa. Freeze-drying of the formulation has been tried as alternative; however, there is a danger of decreasing stability and losing activity

TITLE PARAGRAPH: mRNA-Based Cancer Immunotherapy
The objective of cancer immunotherapy is to manipulate the immune system to effectively eliminate cancer cells 
The first marketed immunotherapies for cancer were recombinant versions of the cytokine interferon-α (IFNα), which were approved by the FDA in 1986 for hairy cell leukemia 
mRNA represents the minimal genetic vector and contains only the elements directly required for the expression of the encoded protein 
Antigen selection is the most difficult task in mRNA-based immunotherapy. In the COVID-19 case, the opposite was the case. The choice was easy and straightforward, at least at the beginning when the selected antigen, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, was rather stable and more or less exempt from mutations. This changed as soon as the Delta and Gamma variants appeared. In cancer immunotherapy, choices for antigens are tumorassociated antigens (TAAs) 
Furthermore, mRNA vaccines are not constrained by the patient's HLA class. mRNA vaccines are preferable over DNA vaccines for several reasons. DNA has to reach the nucleus of the tumor cells in contrast to mRNA, for which it is sufficient to reach the cytosol. For mRNA, there is no danger of splice mutations 
The mRNA modifications described in Section 2 to improve stability and efficacy apply to cancer vaccines as well. Since uridine-rich sequences activate Toll-like receptors 
Despite all these efforts, the tumor is trying to avoid the effect of the treatment by various methods. Tumor escape mechanisms down-regulate the tumor cell surface antigens which means reducing the immunogenicity and thereby the efficacy of the mRNA vaccine 
The route of administration of mRNA-based vaccines plays an important role 
mRNA vaccines are not immunogenic, so that multiple administrations are possible 
According to 
The major obstacle to this objective is the high variability of antigens across different individuals 
Neoantigens should be the major target whenever possible 
Formulations for use in cancer treatment are similar to those described for COVID-19 administration. However, as opposed to the delivery systems of mRNA vaccines for pathogen infections, therapeutic mRNA vaccines for cancer treatments are required to generate both robust CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses 
The induction of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses was shown for several TAAs. In summary, the clinical efficacy of mRNA vaccines looks like a mixed bag of different outcomes ranging from no effect to a rather good response, which means that the route to sufficient efficacy still is rather steep but, nevertheless, nourishes high hopes for the future.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Conclusions
The tremendous success and unbelievable speed in developing and bringing to the market COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has raised high expectations for duplicating this performance in other indications, in particular in cancer therapy. mRNA vaccines are easy to design and can rapidly be modified if there is a need for change, exhibiting an extremely broad versatility of building blocks, structural elements, and formulations of the synthetic mRNA including the targeting of defined cells, duration of expression, and immunological effects. Dosing can be adjusted according to the individual needs of the patients, and there is the possibility to individualize treatment by adjusting the selection of antigen(s) to the specific tumor type of each patient. However, the hurdles in cancer immunotherapy are much higher than in fighting coronaviruses. In particular, the following issues need to be addressed: neoantigen use, LNP modifications, combination treatments, immune escape of cancer, and the therapeutic vs. prophylactic use of mRNA vaccines.
If available, neoantigen-specific vaccines, which are currently considered a top priority in cancer immunotherapy, result in a potential killing of all cells exhibiting the neoantigen epitope but leave any other cancer cells unharmed (which might then start or continue multiplying). As a consequence, the cancer genotype and phenotype changes, and the tumor will continue growing 
LNPs are state-of-the-art for mRNA vaccines. However, they bear several pitfalls. Since they are particles, they can be taken up by macrophages of the liver or the spleenirrespective of their administration route-thereby reducing the activity at the intended site of action, the tumor, and/or leading to side effects at off-target accumulation sites. The side effects might include toxicity and/or immunogenicity 
A further issue that needs to be addressed is the observation that vaccine treatment may not successfully reach the tumor site, in particular solid tumors 
The focus in cancer immunotherapy should also be directed towards prophylactic vaccination, which has already been very successful in HPV and HBV leading to cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. An extension to other tumor types seems mandatory.
