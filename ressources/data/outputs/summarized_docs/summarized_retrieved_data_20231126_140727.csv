 The text discusses the pharmacology of mRNA vaccines, specifically focusing on two types of RNA used as vaccines: non-replicating mRNA and virally derived, self-amplifying RNA. These vaccines differ in their composition and function, with non-replicating mRNA encoding the antigen of interest without additional viral components, while self-amplifying RNA encodes both the antigen and the viral replication machinery for intracellular RNA amplification and protein expression. The article also touches upon the construction and delivery of optimally translated mRNA for therapeutic use.

 The immunogenicity of exogenous mRNA can be modulated through various methods such as purifying IVT mRNA, introducing modified nucleosides, or complexing it with carrier molecules. Exogenous mRNA is inherently immunostimulatory due to recognition by various cell surface, endosomal, and cytosolic innate immune receptors. However, some studies have shown that sequence-optimized, HPLC-purified, unmodified mRNA produces higher levels of protein in cells and animals compared to modified mRNA.

The text also mentions that unmodified mRNA yields more robust protein production than modified mRNA, but includes an adjuvant can increase the potency of some mRNA vaccine formats. Finally, the text notes that self-replicating RNA vaccines have shown increased immunogenicity and effectiveness when formulated in a cationic nano emulsion based on the licensed MF59 adjuvant.
 The article discusses the challenges and opportunities in delivering mRNA vaccines efficiently. Efficient in vivo mRNA delivery is crucial for achieving therapeutic relevance, as exogenous mRNA must penetrate the lipid membrane to reach the cytoplasm for translation. Two basic approaches for delivering mRNA vaccines have been described, including loading DCs ex vivo and re-infusing the transfected cells, or direct injection of mRNA into target tissues. Understanding the physicochemical properties of mRNA complexes and their interactions with cellular membranes can help improve delivery efficiency and organ distribution.

2,nanomaterials-10-00364-v2.txt,mRNA Vaccines Against Infectious Diseases,0.806486249," The use of mRNA in gene therapy has gained popularity due to its advantages over plasmid DNA. However, its instability and potential to trigger immune responses limit its effectiveness as a therapeutic tool. Modifications to mRNA and the development of suitable delivery vehicles are crucial for improving its functionality and efficacy. The manuscript revises strategies to enhance IVT mRNA and discusses nanosystems for successful delivery. The potential applications of mRNA nanomedicines for various diseases and conditions are highlighted.
 Gene therapy involves using genetic material to treat or prevent disease. There are several types of gene therapy including gene augmentation, gene silencing, and gene editing. Synthetic mRNA is a promising alternative to DNA based products because it doesn't require the machinery of the nucleus to be functional. However, the use of IVT mRNA for clinical purposes has been limited by its physical instability, immunogenic capacity, and difficulty in passing through the cellular membrane. Strategies to optimize the functionality and efficacy of IVT mRNA include chemical modifications to its structure, nanosystems, and technological approaches for successful delivery. The potential applications of mRNA nanomedicines include vaccination against infectious diseases, cancer immunotherapy, protein replacement, gene editing, and regenerative medicine.
 The production of IVT mRNA is typically done in cell-free systems, which allows for easier standardization and lower costs compared to producing recombinant proteins in eukaryotic cells. The manufacturing process for IVT mRNA involves using a cell-free in vitro transcription system with a linearized DNA template containing a prokaryotic phage promoter sequence, an open reading frame (ORF), and regulatory untranslated regions (UTRs). The synthetic IVT mRNA can be chemically modified to optimize translation and stability, and to regulate immunogenicity.
 The figure depicts an illustration of the IVT mRNA structure and its modifications to enhance its effectiveness, stability, and immunogenicity. These adjustments include the use of modified nucleotides, pseudouridine formation, and backbone modifications. By implementing these changes, the mRNA's half-life is increased, and its degradation by ribonucleases is slowed down, resulting in improved efficacy and reduced immune response.
 The 5' cap of eukaryotic mRNA is formed by the union of m7G to the first nucleotide of the mRNA through a 5' to 5' triphosphate bridge during transcription. This cap protects the mRNA from degradation and plays a role in various cellular processes such as translation, splicing, and nuclear export. Recently, two other types of 5' caps, cap1 and cap2, have been identified in humans. Synthetic mRNA can be capped post-transcriptionally or cotranscriptionally using enzyme machinery or direct addition of cap analogues, respectively.
 The 5' cap of eukaryotic mRNA is crucial for its stability and function in various cellular processes. It is formed through three enzymatic reactions involving the union of m7G to the first nucleotide of the mRNA by a 5' to 5' triphosphate bridge. Two other types of caps, cap1 and cap2, have been identified in human enzymes. Post-transcriptional capping involves using recombinant enzyme machinery to add the cap0, cap1, or cap2, while co-transcriptional capping involves direct addition of synthetic cap analogues during transcription. However, these methods have limitations, and cytosolic decapping enzymes can remove the mRNA cap, so chemically modified cap analogues can be used to provide resistance.
 The composition of the ORF region of an mRNA can affect its translation efficiency and stability by reducing the amount of certain nucleotides, such as UU and UA, which can make it more resistant to decapping enzymes.

    Please provide the actual text you would like me to summarize and I will be happy to assist you.
 The poly(A) tail in native eukaryotic mRNA is formed by 100-250 adenosines and can be added either during transcription or post-transcriptionally using enzymatic reactions. The length of the poly(A) tail affects the stability and translation efficiency of IVT mRNA.
 The ORF is limited by the UTRs on both sides, including the 5' UTR and 3' UTR. These non-coding regions play important roles in regulating protein expression through their sequences, length, and secondary structures. The Kozak consensus sequence in the 5' UTR and specific sequences in the 3' UTR can influence translation initiation and mRNA stability.
 Incorporating modified nucleosides into mRNA can reduce its ability to stimulate an immune response. This is achieved through interactions with PRRs and other immune cells. By modifying the nucleosides, the mRNA becomes less recognizable to the immune system, reducing the likelihood of an immune response.
 The development of effective delivery systems for mRNA therapeutics is crucial due to the inherent instability of mRNA molecules. Currently, recombinant viruses are widely used for mRNA delivery in clinical trials, but these systems have limitations. Chemical nanocarriers are gaining attention as a promising approach for mRNA delivery due to their potential to overcome these limitations.
 Lipid-based vectors are commonly used non-viral nucleic acid carriers. These vectors consist of cationic lipids that interact with mRNA through electrostatic interactions, forming a complex called a lipoplex. Ionizable lipids, such as DOTMA and DODMA, have been developed as alternatives to cationic lipids. Liposomes and other lipid-based nanoparticles, known as LNPs, are also widely used for mRNA delivery and are considered clinically validated delivery systems for RNA therapy. New classes of lipid delivery molecules, such as lipidoids and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have been developed for mRNA delivery.
 Polymeric systems have been widely investigated for pDNA delivery, but less so for mRNA delivery. Modifying the chemical properties of polymers can enhance their interaction with nucleic acids. Common polymers used for mRNA delivery include PEI, polyacrylates, PBAEs, and PAsp. These polymers can form polyplexes with mRNA, which can enter cells through endocytosis. The binding of cationic polymers and nucleic acids leads to the formation of polyplexes, which can undergo endosomal escape and deliver the mRNA to the cytoplasm.
 Polypeptides are composed of amino acids linked together in blocks or randomly, providing biocompatibility and physicochemical properties to delivery systems. Protamines are small peptides with positively charged arginine residues that enhance nucleic acid uptake by promoting electrostatic interactions. Cell-penetrating peptides can also be used for nucleic acid delivery by promoting grouping of negatively charged glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface or disrupting the lipid bilayer. Artificial viral coat proteins can be formulated into virus-like particles (VLPs) for mRNA transfection.
 Dendrimers are highly branched polymeric macromolecules with well-defined uniform sizes and shapes, and adaptable surface functionalities. They have a basic structure consisting of a central core, repetitive branching units, and terminal groups. These properties make them useful for various applications such as drug delivery, catalysis, and sensors.
 Gold nanoparticles have desirable properties for nucleic acid delivery due to their scalability, functionalizability, and ability to control in vivo toxicity and biodistribution through particle size and surface modification.
 Hybrid systems are composed of different materials such as lipids, polymers, and peptides, which together offer enhanced functionality and flexibility. These hybrids have been used for mRNA delivery, including the delivery of antigens for cancer vaccines and the expression of therapeutic proteins in tumors. Examples include the use of histidylated lipopolyplexes, nanomicelles, and PGAAs brush nanoparticles for mRNA delivery. Recently, a new hybrid nanoplatform combining PLA-based micelles and cationic CPP RALA has been developed for DCs transfection with mRNA.
 The article discusses the expanding potential of mRNA-based treatments due to advancements in IVT mRNA design and manufacturing, particularly in the fields of immunotherapy, protein replacement, gene editing, and regenerative medicine. Current clinical trials are primarily focused on immunotherapy and cancer treatment, but there is still much work to be done to optimize mRNA production and purification processes for commercialization.
 Immunotherapy using mRNA has shown promise in treating various diseases such as infectious diseases and cancer. Modified T cells redirected against diabetogenic CD8+ T cells have been used to prevent type 1 diabetes in mice. Passive immunization by mRNA encoding monoclonal antibodies is another promising approach, offering an alternative to traditional therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness of mRNA synthesis make it an attractive option for the pharmaceutical industry.
 mRNA vaccines have shown promise as an alternative to traditional vaccine types due to their advantages over other approaches. They offer several benefits including ease of production, rapid development, and flexibility in targeting multiple diseases. Additionally, they have the potential to be more effective and safer than existing vaccine types.
 This article discusses the use of mRNA vaccines as a potential substitute for traditional vaccines. These vaccines have several advantages over other types of vaccines, including increased efficacy and the ability to produce high levels of antigen within the body. The article highlights several recent studies that have shown promise in using mRNA vaccines to protect against infectious diseases such as rabies, Zika virus, and HIV.
 Cancer immunotherapy relies on generating a host anti-tumor immune response, primarily through the activation of cytotoxic T cells. mRNA vaccines play a crucial role in this process by expressing antigens in the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to the presentation of proteins on MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells. There are several strategies for delivering mRNA vaccines, including in vivo and ex vivo approaches. In vivo delivery methods include intradermal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous administration, while ex vivo approaches involve transfecting DCs with mRNA. Adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo IVT mRNA-based CAR T cell administration has shown promise in cancer treatment.
 Protein replacement therapy using IVT mRNA has been developed to treat various diseases such as liver, lung, and cystic fibrosis. Moderna and Translate Bio are two companies that have conducted clinical trials using IVT mRNA for these diseases. The therapy works by supplementing missing proteins or activating/inhibiting cellular pathways through the expression of foreign proteins.
 Gene editing has emerged as a new therapeutic option for various diseases. It involves using programmable nucleases to create DNA double-strand breaks in a specific location of the genome, which can then be repaired through either homologous-dependent repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). There are several types of gene editing nucleases, including ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9. These nucleases can be delivered in different forms, such as protein, plasmid DNA, or mRNA. Ex vivo applications of mRNA-based gene editing have been mainly used to edit T cells or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by electroporation. The first allogenic CAR T cell therapy in clinical study is based on TALEN-mRNA, which knockouts T cell receptors (TCR) and the CD52 gene to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and make transplanted allogenic T cells resistant to the lymphodepleting agent alemtuzumab. With the rapid expansion of gene editing as a therapeutic tool, it is expected that the number of clinical studies with gene editing mRNA will significantly increase in the near future.
 The article discusses the use of mRNA therapeutics in regenerative medicine, specifically in the areas of cellular reprogramming and tissue engineering. The author highlights the potential of mRNA-based therapies to generate insulin-secreting β-cells for type 1 diabetes patients and to stimulate bone regeneration. Additionally, the article mentions the use of mRNA-transfected matrices (TAMs) to support cell proliferation and de novo tissue formation. Finally, the author notes that increasing numbers of mRNA studies are attempting to validate proof-of-concept in regenerative medicine.
